## ⭐ HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST:

**1.** Start by making a fork the [**Contribute-To-This-Project-First**](https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Contribute-To-This-Project-First) repository. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Contribute-To-This-Project-First/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a> symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Click on the green `Code` button on your forked Repository, then either the HTTPS or SSH option and, click the icon to copy the URL. Now you have a copy of the project. Thus, you can play around with it locally on your computer.

**3.** Run the following commands into a terminal window (Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, Bash, ZSH). Do this to download the forked copy of this repository to your computer.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Contribute-To-This-Project-First.git
```

**4.** Switch to the cloned folder. You can paste this command into the same terminal window.

```bash
  cd Contribute-To-This-Project-First
```

**5.** Set upstream command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Google-Homepage-Clone-With-HTML-CSS.git
```

**6.** Make a new branch. Your username would make a good branch because it's unique.

```bash
  git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
```

**7.** Sync your fork or local repository with the origin repository:

- In your forked repository click on "Fetch upstream"
- Click "Fetch and merge".

### Alternatively, Git CLI way to Sync forked repository with origin repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

### [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) for Syncing

**8.** Create a file named `your-username.yml` in the directory `public/data`.
Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:

```yml
name: Martin Developers
bio: Software Developer
skills:
- python
- perl
- pascal
location: India
interest: Web Development
```
For clarity, see this [file](https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Contribute-To-This-Project-First/blob/main/public/data/names.yml)

**9.** Stage your changes.

```bash
  git add .
```

**10.** Commit the changes.

```bash
  git commit -m "Add <your-github-username>"
```

**11.** Check the status of your repository.

```bash
  git status
```

**12.** The response should be like this:

```bash
On branch <name-of-your-branch>
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**13.** Pushing your repository to GitHub.

```bash
  git push origin <name-of-your-branch>
```

or

```bash
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
```

**14.** Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!
